# User Auth Service

The User Auth Service is a microservice designed to handle user authentication and authorization in a secure and scalable manner. It utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for token-based authentication and is built with Spring Boot. This service supports user registration, login, and role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register with the system.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users and generates JWT tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Supports user roles for fine-grained access management.
- **Secure Token Storage**: Uses JWT for secure session management.
- **Swagger Documentation**: API documentation is available via Swagger UI.

## Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.3.3
- Spring Security
- JJWT for JWT handling
- MySQL for data persistence
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
